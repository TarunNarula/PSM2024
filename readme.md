- **The Scrum Guide:** [Link](https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf#zoom=100)
Read the Scrum Guide repeatedly and complete the Open Assessment until consistently achieving a 100% score. It's crucial to note that even if you work as a Scrum Master and apply Scrum in your daily tasks, your practices might deviate from the Scrum Guide. Even if your methods seem effective based on your experience, if they don't align with the guide, they will be deemed incorrect.
